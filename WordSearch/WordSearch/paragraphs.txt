We gathered surveys from 107 game design and development professionals and 300 middle school students, before and after a game development class, about the value of teaching game development in a middle school class. Then we compared the responses of the 7th- and 8th-graders with what the game developers said they felt would be important about making games. We hope this information will help teachers who are constructing game development classes, and show the broader view of the value inherent in game development that professional game makers can provide.

Making computer games can be a great entry point into computer science. Writing code is a major part of making video games, and 58 percent of the professionals surveyed said that programming was a key element of game development. However, they were quick to point out that the great thrill of programming for game development is to make games enjoyable for others.

This consideration for how others experience games is at the heart of game development, in the form of both imagining another's experience of the game and direct feedback by users. It's not coding just to code, it is coding to create something fun for others.
